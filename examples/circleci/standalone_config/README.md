# Stand-alone CircleCI config example

Example of a stand-alone generated Aspect Workflows CircleCI config that is written to the source
tree with the `workflows_circleci_config` rule. In this case, the name of the rule must be
`config` so that the generated file is `config.yml`.

Follow this example if there are no other CircleCI configuration other than Aspect Workflows.
